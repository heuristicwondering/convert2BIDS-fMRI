# Convert2BIDs
## A step-by-step workflow for converting raw imaging data into anonymized, preprocessed, BIDs-compliant data sets ready for sharing on [OpenNeuro](https://openneuro.org/).

---
### Why this Exists
The intent of the resources you will find here is to compile current tools and knowledge on best practices converting raw neuroimaging data into high quality, maintainable, and shareable data sets. Our goal is to lower the barrier to good data keeping practices and increase the number of openly available data sets.

We provide step-by-step instructions and make minimal assumptions about prior knowledge working with imaging data and the associated tools. Where possible, we provide rationales for decision points in this workflow and explanations of the tools as processes employed.

If you find this work useful, find any errors, or discover outdated information, please consider lending your time and knowledge to creating a more robust resource for the neuroimaging community.

## Getting Started
Convert2BIDs is divided into **three** major steps. Each of these can be executed independently of each other but often make critical assumptions about the format of the data based on execution of previous steps. It's highly recommended following steps in the order provided. Simply click on each link to be taken to the relevant instruction page.
